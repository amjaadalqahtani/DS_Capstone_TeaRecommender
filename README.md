# DS Capstone: Tea Recommender (2021)

Tea Recommendation System using scraped information from online tea stores and health benefits from scientific journals. It suggests tea based on user preference and ingredients of the tea. The algorithm takes tea name as input and returns the top 5 most similar teas as output. This is a project for the capstone requirement part of the course "Data Science Immersive" by Misk Skills.

## Contributing
The dataset file "clean_megalist.csv" is compiled from 9 different tea brands, the zip file "scraped_teabrands.zip" includes the scraped raw data. I made them for the purposes of the class, but both can be used to practice with data science projects. Feel free to expirement with it! Other files have my own research and code for information gathering, data tidying, and modeling a simple recommendation system.
