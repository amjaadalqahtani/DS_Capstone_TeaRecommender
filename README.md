# DS Capstone: Tea Recommender (2021)

Tea Recommendation System using scraped information from online tea stores and health benefits from scientific journals. It suggests tea based on user preference and ingredients of the tea. The algorithm takes tea name as input and returns the top 5 most similar teas as output. This is a project for the capstone requirement part of the course "Data Science Immersive" offered by MCIT and Misk Skills in collaboration with Scavetta Academy.

Dataset titled "clean_megalist.csv" can be used for practicing data science projects. The dataset was built for this project as a fun application of webscraping. I might update it in the future. 
**Other files are personal and may only be used within the scope of the Misk DSI course.**
