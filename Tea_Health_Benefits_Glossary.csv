Pure tea,
green tea,"high in flavonoids that can help boost your heart health by lowering bad cholesterol and reducing blood clotting. Studies show this type of tea can also help lower blood pressure, triglycerides and total cholesterol. has a possible impact on liver, breast, prostate and colorectal cancers. Tea catechins are the major player in the biological activity of teas. The most biologically active of the catechins, EGCG, has been found to inhibit angiogenesis, causing nutritional deficiency in tumor cells.  This tea variety has also shown to be anti-inflammatory, which helps keep your skin clear and glowing. Polyphenols, or flavonoids, are likely a key component to what makes tea a healthful drink. These chemical compounds act as antioxidants, which control the damaging effects of free radicals in the body. Free radicals can alter DNA by stealing its electrons, and this mutated DNA can increase LDL cholesterol or alter cell membrane traffic—both harmful to our health. Though green tea is often believed to be richer in polyphenols than black or oolong (red) teas, studies show that—with the exception of decaffeinated tea—all plain teas have about the same levels of these chemicals, albeit in different proportions."
matcha,"the only form of tea in which the leaves are ingested, matcha contains even more antioxidants that regular green tea"
black tea *includes earl grey,"flavonoids that combat inflammation and support healthy immune function. However, you don’t have to merely drink black tea to benefit from its healthy properties.

Precautions,
"The connection between GTE consumption and idiopathic hepatitis is hard to explain. It seems more likely that instead of toxic exposure, the condition may rather be a triggered reaction similar to other cases of idiopathic hepatitis. The paradox is that there is no hint in the literature that indicates whole GT causes liver toxicity. Therefore, adverse effects may be specifically related only to the extracts. Although the total risk is considered to be quite low, these extracts have to be taken with caution, and automedication is not always a good idea. Liver function has to be checked soon after beginning the treatment. As in the case of all medications, the risk-benefit calculation must be favorable. (Herbal Medicine: Biomolecular and Clinical Aspects by Serafini M. et al. 2nd edition.)",
"Future research on the health effects of tea in humans should focus on the biological significance of its in vivo catabolism...Most polyphenols present in tea, with probably the only exception of EGCG, undergo drastic modification as a result of reaction with human and microbial enzymes. The molecules generated by this interaction are concentrated in biological fluids and should be studied for their long-terms effects in human intervention studies. Moreover, gut microflora differ greatly among subjects, and this feature could mean different microbial catabolism and, consequently, different biological effects. Therefore, future intervention studies should consider the colonic microflora profile of each volunteer to check for possible interactions. The observed antioxidant effect of tea ingestion in vivo requires more evidence about the mechanism of action through which this effect is delivered. (Herbal Medicine: Biomolecular and Clinical Aspects by Serafini M. et al. 2nd edition.)",
"Possible mechanisms of antioxidant action such as induction of endogenous redox-controlled pathways or direct effect of polyphenols metabolites should be unraveled, providing clear-cut evidence in long-term intervention studies to isolate the molecules responsible for the effect. The experimental evidence in humans suggests a potential role for GT in modulating inflammatory response in vivo. However, the limited number of studies and the contrasting results obtained suggest a strong need for increasing the body of evidence in tailored human intervention studies before drawing final conclusions about the anti-inflammatory role of tea polyphenols. (Herbal Medicine: Biomolecular and Clinical Aspects by Serafini M. et al. 2nd edition.)",
"Some advertisements claim that tea can speed weight loss, but research on the effects of green tea and fat reduction have shown little promise of weight loss benefits. Moreover, it’s best to skip any so-called “weight loss” teas that may contain potentially harmful substances such as laxatives. (""Tea"", Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health)",
