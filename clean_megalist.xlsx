Snow Buds, or é›ªèŠ½ Xue YaÂ in Chinese, is a unique and more recent style of green tea which typically uses a white tea cultivar and employs a process that is a combination of white and Chinese green tea, revealing delicate floral nuance. Many Chinese green teas use pan-frying alone to halt the oxidation process, which imparts more flavor into the finished product of the tea. Â The process used for this Xue YaÂ combines tumble drum roasting and oven drying to coax out sweetness and concentrated umami. The dual process allows the subtle florality to take center stage and creates a tea with fewer vegetal notes. Â The Jinggu Da Bai, or literally â€œBig White,â€ with Jinggu being an autonomous county in Yunnan, is renowned for its downy, fuzz and delicate flavor.

The Okabe region of Shizuoka, Japan is famous for its amazing Gyokuro and high-end, wrap-shadedsencha variants known as Kabusecha. The distinguishing characteristics of Kabusecha are rich and smooth taste with low-tannin and a deep, blue-green jade leaf and opaque infusion color. Kabusecha has an unmistakable, sought-after and hard to define savory, sweet and stimulating aromatic profile called kabuse kaori. The natural farming practiced in Okabe focuses on composting and traditional enrichment of the soil to boost amino acid and special flavor. The bushes for this Okabe cultivar blend were shaded for more than 2 weeks prior to harvest in order to elevate chlorophyll levels and amino acid contents much like Gyokuro or Tencha. The result is a tea of sublime balance with deep umami and rich layers of flavor and residual sweetness.

Rishi is lucky enough to be one of the few to whom Tsuji-san sells his matcha, which has been analyzed to have the highest amino acids scores and L-theanine content of any matcha in Japan and the world. Each cultivar gives us specific tasting notes. In Tsuji-san's Matcha Gokou, we experience an invigorating flavor with a pure emerald hue and hints of spruce. Tea bushes for premium matcha are harvested once per year. The farming technique is unique as it utilizes shading, and this focuses the plant's energy on the top, tender leaves.

Harvest: Spring 2021

This early spring, high mountain micro-lot is from ancient tea trees harvested by the Hmong Ethnic people located in Suoi Giang, Yen Bai in Northern Vietnam. Shan Tuyáº¿t translates as â€œSnow Mountainâ€ and references the clouds and cold foggy mists where these old trees grow. Snow Shan teas are not inherently named for their processing method and plucking standard but are better defined by the ancient tea trees, high elevation and how they grow. The tea leaves are coated in snow white silvery down, and the trees themselves are large and gnarled, covered in misty dew, lichen, moss and wild orchids. The trees have a unique look and patina with their frosted, snow white flora.

The ancient trees of Yen Bai Province are highly revered in Vietnam and China for the complexity of the tannin structure and the overall taste of tea these trees produce. The downy bud-and-a-leaf are processed using a technique similar to Ban Hong Chao, creating a curled tea leaf with a frosted appearance. Don't let the delicate nature of the tea fool youâ€”the tea has a vibrant, energizing feel.

This green tea is crafted from the famed Long Jing #43 cultivar. The processing method of this tea was adapted from an old style steamed green tea known as Enshi Yulu (Jade Dew from Enshi). Jade Dew from the Enshi region was a Tribute Tea during the Qing dynasty and is considered one of the historical precursors of temomi sencha and early gyokuro.

It was made by steaming, cooling down, hand-kneading the leaf into a pristine pine needle shape and then gently drying on heated tables until the shape and aroma is fixed. The result is a vibrant, full-bodied and fresh character with plenty of umami characteristic of spring green tea. It is said that during the 1600s, Japanese Taoist students traveling in this Enshi region (famous for its remote forests and Taoist temples) experienced this green tea process and took inspiration back to Japan for the making of sencha and refined steamed teas.","Yulu Jade Dew","China","day","green","Organic green tea",58,"rishi-tea","inflammation, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, unclear skin","green tea"

The intense shading forces the bushes to make their leaves fatter and greener, with increased chlorophyll to seek out the sun. In turn, this farming practice greatly enhances the nootropic and neuro-stimulating substances.

The tradition of scenting tea with flowers such as jasminelotus, pomelo blossoms and other types of flowers is a time-honored craft. Simple infusions of dried flowers were consumed frequently during the Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE) as a purifying palette cleanser before the tea ceremony and really came into vogue during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 CE) when many types of flower-scented teas were created. Chrysanthemums from Korea are prized as one of the most flavorful types of chrysanthemum that can be selected for tea. These blossoms are grown for us in Hadong region of Korea and have a classic taste with core bitter-sweetness and the complex aroma of wintergreen, pine, honey and spring blossoms.

Four Seasons Spring Oolong is a lightly oxidized, tightly rolled, ball shaped oolong tea sourced from our partners of twenty years in Taiwan's central highlands. This oolong is crafted from the Si Ji Chun å››å­£æ˜¥, or literally â€œFour Seasons Spring,â€ cultivar. The tea has a golden-green, medium-bodied infusion with very floral, long-lasting aromatics evocative of fresh gardenia, freesia blossoms and tropical fruits.

When Korean chrysanthemums are combined with this oolong, the aroma and flavor experience is transformed into something really special and energetic. In Korean herbalist practice, chrysanthemum is regarded as cooling, purifying and a natural source of antioxidants. Chrysanthemum flowers produce various types of flavonoids, which results in anti-inflammatory effects.

We then assemble and taste trials of cultivar blends to create the perfect CHO WA (harmony and balance) of amaku (umami), koku (density), awaku (briskness), and shibuku (bitterness). The cultivar components of Kirishima Blend shift from season to season, according to our collaborative effort to create the most balanced and vivid expression of this southern Japanese appellation of origin.

Rishi is lucky enough to be one of the few to whom Tsuji-san sells his matcha, which has been analyzed to have the highest amino acids scores and L-theanine content of any matcha in Japan and the world. Each cultivar gives us specific tasting notes. In Tsuji-san's Matcha Gokou, we experience an invigorating flavor with a pure emerald hue and hints of spruce. Tea bushes for premium matcha are harvested once per year. The farming technique is unique as it utilizes shading, and this focuses the plant's energy on the top, tender leaves. The intense shading forces the bushes to make their leaves fatter and greener, with increased chlorophyll to seek out the sun. In turn, this farming practice greatly enhances the nootropic and neuro-stimulating substances.

This Premium Iron Goddess of Mercy or TieguanyinÂ is crafted from the Cui Yu, â€œJade,â€ cultivar. Handpicked tea leaves were harvested from an ecologically managed old growth garden in central Taiwan. This tea goes through a process of medium oxidation, ball-roll shaping and moderate initial roasting to create the base tea. Then after some weeks of resting the batch an artistic and old school baking regimen that takes several more weeks is employed to complete the tea. This baking brings out a sort of â€œcaramelizedâ€ sweetness and creamy aroma due to the Maillard reactionâ€”the same transformation that occurs in baking bread, roasting sweet potatoes or roasting coffee. Oolong tea artisans produce baked teas that range from blonde light roasts to medium and deeper roasts. This tea is deeply baked in the Nong Xiang, or â€œdeep fragranceâ€ style. Be sure to rinse the tea to warm up the tea leaves and smooth out the flavor a bit before commencing your Gongfu Cha brewing series of multiple infusions.","Iron Goddess of Mercy Premium Roast","Taiwan","day","golden","Oolong tea",44,"rishi-tea","cancer prevention, anxiety, low alertness, inflammation, type 2 diabetes","Oolong Tea"

This vintage tea consists of aged shu Pu'er that is compressed into a cake and packed in traditional bamboo leaf bundles called a tong. This reserve Pu'er tea is released only when it is ready. A deep garnet infusion with a dense, opaque liquor bears a mellow sweetness that drinks remarkably smooth with a rich earth body.

There are two types of Pu'er tea: sheng (raw, green) and shu (ripe, dark). Both originate from a rustic sun-dried green tea called shaiqing. Shu Pu'er is made by pile-fermenting shaiqing teas over a period of 85-120 days. Ancient Pu'er Palace is our top grade of shu Pu'er, and is made using leaves picked from ancient tea trees that are hundreds of years old.

Like fine wine, Pu'er tea has the ability to be aged and released in vintages. Young shu Pu'er teas (2-3 years) typically have an assertive body and bold strength. The body and mouthfeel become richer and more integrated as the shu Pu'er continues to age from 4-8 years.","Shu Pu'er Tea Cake","China","day","brown","Organic Pu'erh tea",23,"rishi-tea","cancer prevention, weight gain, high cholesterol","puerh tea"
