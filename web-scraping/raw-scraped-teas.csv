The cool, Springtime temperatures at high elevation in the Himalayas inhibits tea leaf oxidation, so while Himalayan Spring is technically a black tea you will notice the leaves are pear green in color.

Set high in the Himalayas, Darjeeling is cherished by connoisseurs for yielding teas of extraordinary aromatic depth. Many of the gardens from which we source our teas were founded in the 19th century. While cultivar selection is a factor, the real complexity of Darjeeling teas is to be explored in the diversity of terrain in the gardens. The range in elevation, the pitch of the slope and the amount of sun exposure lead to distinctive differences in character. Each garden has a signature aroma profile. While the first flush produces greenish-golden teas with a tight structure and floral bouquet, the second flush is treasured for more ripened notes of fruits and features a lovely orange-red infusion.

Earl Grey dates back to the nineteenth century tea trade when Charles Grey, the 2nd Earl Grey, was presented with a gift of Taitaicha—tea scented with citrus blossoms—during his travels in Canton. After Grey returned home, his namesake tea became wildly popular when the tea salons of Europe infused black teas with the essence of the bergamot citrus fruit that grows in Reggio Di' Calabria, Italy. Our organic Earl Grey combines robust and fruity Thai black tea with mellow, caramel sweet Yunnan Dian Hong. This original blend perfectly complements the floral high notes of geranium and rose found in our first-pressing bergamot essential oil.

In Thailand, the flowers have been used for centuries for hair and scalp health in ancient types of shampoo.

Nowadays, the flowers are very popular in tea and herbal blends because they easily infuse their vivid blue pigment. The flowers are infused in water, sugar, milk or oil as a natural food color.

The adaptogenic properties of schisandra have been cited for centuries in Asian tradition for helping beautify and protect the skin from environmental stress. It is also said that schisandra's concentrated B-vitamin complex and antioxidant activity help support healthy liver function and hormonal balance.

The plant is high in antioxidants and is considered to have a warming effect, while green tea is known for its cooling effects.

Many of the same antioxidants and aromatic compounds in artemisia are also contained in lemongrass, verbena, wintergreen, and other types of herbs. The components coumarin and quinine are also found in the plant, which are a key ingredient in tonic water and tea cocktails.","Organic Artemisia annua",NA,"5 minutes","/product/image/medium/oaan-sana_artemisia_looseleaf_sana.png","$20.00","Artemisia","Organic Caffeine-Free Pure Botanical",NA,NA,NA,"USA",NA,NA,NA,"Artemisia","https://rishi-tea.com/organic-loose-leaf-herbal-tea/artemisia-tea-organic-loose-leaf?returnurl=%2fpure-botanicals%2f%3fcount%3d15",NA,NA,NA

Tulsi is renowned for its calming effect, known to offer cognitive and memory-enhancing properties as well as being anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting. There are quite a few types of cultivars referred to as Holy Basil, and this particular variety is sometimes referred to as “Spice Basil” with its unique, spicy aroma. Kapoor Tulsi plants have purple flowers, in contrast to varying colored blooms on other types of Holy Basil.

This early spring, high mountain micro-lot is from ancient tea trees harvested by the Dao Ethnic people located in Vi Xuyen, Ha Giang in Northern Vietnam. Shan Tuyết translates as “Snow Mountain” and references the clouds and cold foggy mists where these old trees grow. The tea leaves are coated in snow white silvery down, and the trees themselves are large and gnarled, covered in misty dew, lichen, moss and wild orchids. The trees have a unique look and patina with their frosted, snow white flora.

The ancient trees of Ha Giang Province are highly revered in Vietnam and China for the complexity of the tannin structure and the overall taste of tea these trees produce. The young, downy leaves are processed using a “green snow needle” technique, creating a pure bud with a frosted appearance. Snow Shan is produced in many provinces, but Ha Giang is the premier origin.

Each year the Nishi family produces a special batch of hand-picked Shincha to celebrate the old-school artisan technique of harvesting by hand. Shincha literally means “new tea” and is representative of the first plucks of the tea harvest. Each region in Japan sees a slightly different first harvest due to the great variance in terrain and the effects of elevation. This year on Kagoshima Mountain they picked exclusively from Saemidori plants to make this single-cultivar Shincha. It comes as no surprise that Saemidori translates to “bright green” when observing the brilliant hue of its infusion. This Shincha produces a vivid, very bright green liquor and has a remarkably fresh-savory flavor profile that produces a slightly salty umami balanced with a pleasant, sweet grassiness.

This tea is from the remote, high mountain and deep forest tea gardens of the eastern region of Tenryu Ward in Shizuoka, Japan. Tenryu high mountain valley tea gardens have a much later first flush harvest schedule due to the limited days of sunshine and dramatic differences between daytime and nighttime temperatures. We selected a specialized Shizuoka cross-breed cultivar named Koushun from the Mother of Kurosawa and the Father of Kanayamidori tea bushes. Koushun is favored for specialized oxidized teas and kamairicha (pan-fired, farmer’s sickle shaped tea).

Gyokuro, literally “jade dew,” is the most prestigious and rare shade-grown green tea from Japan. This year we selected two gyokuro teas from the esteemed Uji region of Japan. Uji teas tend to emphasize richness of umami taste with savory and sweet flavors akin to kombu, snap pea, broth and mushroom-dashi. Shupin translates as “competition grade.” This top-shelf Uji Gyokuro comes from one of our farm partners in Uji, a 5th generation Gyokuro and matcha tea producing family. This family creates vintage blends for a gyokuro tea contest held annually in Kyoto. Vintage blends are released each year at the outset of Autumn. This 2021 edition has zero astringency and a seriously high level of umami and sweetness. The richness of the infusion is amazing and almost gelatinous, like an emerald green dashi broth with sweet and tangy kombu and fruity, flowery notes of oyster mushroom.","Green tea",NA,"null","/product/image/medium/usgyo50-rp_usgyo-sana-uji-shupin-gyokuro-loose-leaf-japanese-green-tea.jpg","$46.00","Uji Shupin Gyokuro","Garden Direct Green Tea",NA,NA,NA,"Uji, Japan",NA,NA,NA,"Uji Shupin Gyokuro","https://rishi-tea.com/garden-direct-seasonal-tea/uji-shupin-gyokuro-2021?returnurl=%2fgreen-tea-organic-loose-leaf%2f%3fcount%3d61",NA,NA,NA

Harvest: April 22, 2021

The Nishi Family is renowned throughout Japan as pioneers of organic tea cultivation. This year, they selected several specialized lots for us, including this micro-lot of shincha crafted from the Asatsuyu cultivar. Asatsuyu means “morning dew” and is an original cultivar developed in the modern Japanese agriculture breeding programs from the 1950’s. Harvested in the early spring season, it matures to flush just after Saemidori and before Yabukita.

Picked at its peak quality with deep milky sweetness, rich umami and freshness, the timing of the harvest yielded such a low fiber content, when infused, the leaves turn into an emerald jelly-like substance, akin to what one may expect from brewed gyokuro leaves. Kabuse shading enhances its deep green color and creamy sweetness.

This shincha is a vivid green example of chumushi (mid-steamed) process, which creates a smaller leaf particle size that in turn results in a full-bodied and opaque emerald cup. It is invigorating with deep umami and creamy sweetness balanced with fresh hints of snap pea. The bright emerald green infusion is lively and full of spring energy.","Organic green tea",NA,"null","/product/image/medium/onsa100-rp_nishishinchaasatsuyu-looseleaf-sana.png","$32.00","Nishi-san’s Single Cultivar Asatsuyu Shincha","Garden Direct Organic Green Tea",NA,NA,NA,"Nishi-san's Garden, Kirishima Mountain, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan",NA,NA,NA,"Nishi-san’s Single Cultivar Asatsuyu Shincha","https://rishi-tea.com/garden-direct-seasonal-tea/nishi-sans-single-cultivar-asatsuyu-shincha-2021?returnurl=%2fgreen-tea-organic-loose-leaf%2f%3fcount%3d61",NA,NA,NA

Each cultivar gives us specific tasting notes. In Tsuji-san's Matcha Samidori, we experience an unctuous aroma with silken, creamy mouthfeel and savory umami reminiscent of uni. Tea bushes for premium matcha are harvested once per year. The farming technique is unique as it utilizes shading, and this focuses the plant's energy on the top, tender leaves. The intense shading forces the bushes to make their leaves fatter and greener, with increased chlorophyll to seek out the sun. In turn, this farming practice greatly enhances the nootropic and neuro-stimulating substances.

Snow Buds, or 雪芽 Xue Ya in Chinese, is a unique and more recent style of green tea which typically uses a white tea cultivar and employs a process that is a combination of white and Chinese green tea, revealing delicate floral nuance. Many Chinese green teas use pan-frying alone to halt the oxidation process, which imparts more flavor into the finished product of the tea.  The process used for this Xue Ya combines tumble drum roasting and oven drying to coax out sweetness and concentrated umami. The dual process allows the subtle florality to take center stage and creates a tea with fewer vegetal notes.  The Jinggu Da Bai, or literally “Big White,” with Jinggu being an autonomous county in Yunnan, is renowned for its downy, fuzz and delicate flavor. The trichomes are left intact on this tea, so take note of the silver down present on the leaf.","Organic green tea",NA,"null","/product/image/medium/omqsb100-rp_yunnansnowbuds-looseleaftea-sana.jpg","$28.00","Yunnan Snow Buds","Garden Direct Organic Green Tea",NA,NA,NA,"Jinggu, Yunnan, China",NA,NA,NA,"Yunnan Snow Buds","https://rishi-tea.com/garden-direct-seasonal-tea/yunnan-snow-buds-2021?returnurl=%2fgreen-tea-organic-loose-leaf%2f%3fcount%3d61",NA,NA,NA

The Homare grade contains vintage ranges from 2008-2021 blended to highlight the classic, deep and mellow taste of Uji tea. Vintage blends are released each year at the outset of Autumn.

The Okabe region of Shizuoka, Japan is famous for its amazing Gyokuro and high-end, wrap-shadedsencha variants known as Kabusecha. The distinguishing characteristics of Kabusecha are rich and smooth taste with low-tannin and a deep, blue-green jade leaf and opaque infusion color. Kabusecha has an unmistakable, sought-after and hard to define savory, sweet and stimulating aromatic profile called kabuse kaori. The natural farming practiced in Okabe focuses on composting and traditional enrichment of the soil to boost amino acid and special flavor. The bushes for this Okabe cultivar blend were shaded for more than 2 weeks prior to harvest in order to elevate chlorophyll levels and amino acid contents much like Gyokuro or Tencha. The result is a tea of sublime balance with deep umami and rich layers of flavor and residual sweetness.

Its distinctive and deep tasting profile makes Asanoka a special cultivar for kabuse sencha and tencha for matcha.","Organic green tea",NA,"null","/product/image/medium/otasc50-rp_singlecultivarasanokatencha-looseleaf-sana.jpg","$28.00","Single Cultivar Asanoka Tencha","Garden Direct Organic Green Tea",NA,NA,NA,"Kirishima Mountain, Japan",NA,NA,NA,"Single Cultivar Asanoka Tencha","https://rishi-tea.com/garden-direct-seasonal-tea/single-cultivar-asanoka-tencha-2021?returnurl=%2fgreen-tea-organic-loose-leaf%2f%3fcount%3d61",NA,NA,NA

This is an amazingly floral, piney and stimulating micro-lot of Green Needles produced from the single-bud plucks of a cultivar localized to Hubei known as E-Cha #1. This cultivar of tea bush has a strong tannin profile with expressive flowery and fresh evergreen aromatics when it is harvested during the early spring. E-Cha #1 cultivar is so strong that we only make “Jade Buds” single-bud pluck style of Green Needles with it during the early spring. As the temperature and humidity rise in the E-Cha #1 gardens after early spring so does the total tannin and polyphenols. The subsequent later Spring and Summer harvests of E-Cha 1 are made into our series of Yi Hong gongfu red tea.

Green Needles (Lu Zhen) is a traditional pine needle-shaped green tea from Hubei province. After withering, the tea leaves are fired in a small tumble-roasters, then shaped using special heated table machines that shake the tea leaves back-and-forth repeatedly to coax the leaves into straight needles. The tea leaves are initially dried on hot air-flow tables while stirred and then finally baked to perfection in an oven. Infuse with care not to over-steep in order to savor the rich complexity of this early spring tea.","null",NA,"null","/product/image/medium/omgn100-rp_greenneedlesecha1-looseleaf-sana.jpg","$68.00","Green Needles Single Cultivar E-Cha #1","Organic Garden Direct Green Tea",NA,NA,NA,"Jin Long Ping Village, Xuan'En County, Hubei Province, China",NA,NA,NA,"Green Needles Single Cultivar E-Cha #1","https://rishi-tea.com/garden-direct-seasonal-tea/green-needles-single-cultivar-e-cha1-jade-buds?returnurl=%2fgreen-tea-organic-loose-leaf%2f%3fcount%3d61",NA,NA,NA

This superior quality jasmine tea uses less rounds of scenting than Jasmine Pearl, but is equally beautiful to behold visually and even more stunning in its lush, abundantly aromatic sweetness. This innovative tea is made from pure spring harvest tea buds – the same buds that are typically used to make Jasmine Pearl – but are left in a natural, slightly twisted shape instead of being rolled into a pearl. The result is a tea with an unimaginably rich sweetness that naturally complements the sweet perfume of Jasmine. Because Moonlight Jasmine is not rolled into a pearl, far fewer rounds of scenting are needed to achieve a deeply fixed floral aroma.

This sencha selection comes from the southern island prefecture of Kagoshima, home to active volcanos. The area is renowned for its mineral-rich soils, which contribute to the vibrancy and taste of the tea.

The Yabukita cultivar is the primary cultivar grown in all of Japan. The Asanoka cultivar is a special hybrid of Yabukita and a China bush variety, developed in the 1990s in Kagoshima. Asanoka is regarded for its unique aromatic complexity, density of flavor and rich green infusion. Saemidori translates to “bright green” and produces a vivid bright green liquor, with a remarkably fresh-savory flavor profile.

Harvest: May 12, 2020

Rishi is lucky enough to be one of the few to whom Tsuji-san sells his matcha, which has been analyzed to have the highest amino acids scores and L-theanine content of any matcha in Japan and the world. Each cultivar gives us specific tasting notes. In Tsuji-san's Matcha Gokou, we experience an invigorating flavor with a pure emerald hue and hints of spruce. Tea bushes for premium matcha are harvested once per year. The farming technique is unique as it utilizes shading, and this focuses the plant's energy on the top, tender leaves. The intense shading forces the bushes to make their leaves fatter and greener, with increased chlorophyll to seek out the sun.

Cultivar: Yen Bai Ancient Trees
Elevation: 1500m
Harvest: Spring 2021

This early spring, high mountain micro-lot is from ancient tea trees harvested by the Hmong Ethnic people located in Suoi Giang, Yen Bai in Northern Vietnam. Shan Tuyết translates as “Snow Mountain” and references the clouds and cold foggy mists where these old trees grow. Snow Shan teas are not inherently named for their processing method and plucking standard but are better defined by the ancient tea trees, high elevation and how they grow. The tea leaves are coated in snow white silvery down, and the trees themselves are large and gnarled, covered in misty dew, lichen, moss and wild orchids. The trees have a unique look and patina with their frosted, snow white flora.

The ancient trees of Yen Bai Province are highly revered in Vietnam and China for the complexity of the tannin structure and the overall taste of tea these trees produce. The downy bud-and-a-leaf are processed using a technique similar to Ban Hong Chao, creating a curled tea leaf with a frosted appearance. Don’t let the delicate nature of the tea fool you—the tea has a vibrant, energizing feel.

This green tea is crafted from the famed Long Jing #43 cultivar. The processing method of this tea was adapted from an old style steamed green tea known as Enshi Yulu (Jade Dew from Enshi). Jade Dew from the Enshi region was a Tribute Tea during the Qing dynasty and is considered one of the historical precursors of temomi sencha and early gyokuro.

It was made by steaming, cooling down, hand-kneading the leaf into a pristine pine needle shape and then gently drying on heated tables until the shape and aroma is fixed. The result is a vibrant, full-bodied and fresh character with plenty of umami characteristic of spring green tea. It is said that during the 1600s, Japanese Taoist students traveling in this Enshi region (famous for its remote forests and Taoist temples) experienced this green tea process and took inspiration back to Japan for the making of sencha and refined steamed teas.","Organic green tea",NA,"null","/product/image/medium/omyft100-rp_yulujadedew-looseleaf-sana.jpg","$58.00","Yulu Jade Dew","Garden Direct Organic Green Tea",NA,NA,NA,"Jin Long Ping Village, Xuan'En County, Hubei Province, China",NA,NA,NA,"Yulu Jade Dew","https://rishi-tea.com/garden-direct-seasonal-tea/yulu-jade-dew-2021?returnurl=%2fgreen-tea-organic-loose-leaf%2f%3fcount%3d61",NA,NA,NA

This chumushi (mid-steamed) shincha offers a balance of freshness and umami with a creamy, toasted hazelnut note from particular roasting, enhanced with Kabuse (wrapped shading) to bring out deep sweetness and special aromas.

Harvest: May 7, 2020 

Rishi is lucky enough to be one of the few to whom Tsuji-san sells his matcha, which has been analyzed to have the highest amino acids scores and L-theanine content of any matcha in Japan and the world. Each cultivar gives us specific tasting notes. In Tsuji-san's Matcha Asahi, we experience a velvety mouthfeel with hints of macadamia nut and kombu. Tea bushes for premium matcha are harvested once per year. The farming technique is unique as it utilizes shading, and this focuses the plant's energy on the top, tender leaves. The intense shading forces the bushes to make their leaves fatter and greener, with increased chlorophyll to seek out the sun. In turn, this farming practice greatly enhances the nootropic and neuro-stimulating substances.

Honyama is a notable distinction of sencha from a high mountain region of Shizuoka, Japan. Okouchi is a small town within this region which was historically significant as one of the premium cultivation sites of tribute tea for the Emperor. Our partners keep up with rare practices of handpicking and light steaming with mountain spring water to honor the traditions of this prestigious tea region.

The valley farms and cool, foggy weather provide a special quality of tea that exudes the phenomenon known as Yamano Kaori, literally """"mountain aroma."""" The mists shroud the tea bushes during peak harvesting season, which enhances the floral aromas in the tea and allows for gradual growth, concentrating amino acids and reducing sharp tannin.

Yamano Kaori is understood as """"mountain character"""" by Japanese tasting experts and is defined by the balance of bittersweetness and mild briskness of tannin. The infusion is lustrous with a lemony-lime yellow hue, has stimulating springtime energy and high levels of umami, amino acids and sweetness.","null",NA,"null","/product/image/medium/hok100-rp_honyamaokouchisencha-teacircle.png","$36.00","Honyama Okouchi Sencha","Garden Direct Green Tea",NA,NA,NA,"Shizuoka, Japan",NA,NA,NA,"Honyama Okouchi Sencha","https://rishi-tea.com/shincha-japanese-spring-tea/honyama-okouchi-sencha-2021?returnurl=%2fgreen-tea-organic-loose-leaf%2f%3fcount%3d61",NA,NA,NA

Whether tea or wine, connoisseurs seek gems that best express the nuances of terroir and vintage. Both Pu'er and Bordeaux benefit from the richening effect of aging, increasing in complexity as time passes on.

It has been cultivated for thousands of years as a special beautifying tonic herb found in numerous traditional culinary and medicinal recipes. Schisandra is celebrated in China and Korea as an adaptogen—herbs that alleviate stress and help the body deal with physical and mental fatigue. The adaptogenic properties of schisandra have been cited for centuries in Asian tradition for helping beautify and protect the skin from environmental stress. It is also said that schisandra's concentrated B-vitamin complex and antioxidant activity help support healthy liver function and hormonal balance. Schisandra is harvested in late summer and can be pressed fresh into juice or sun-dried for use in a variety of preparations such as herbal teas, vitality tonics and infused liquors.

Its enchanting, unforgettable aroma is created through an artisanal method of tea scenting that dates back more than 800 years. Jasmine blossoms are gathered during midsummer evenings and spread amongst tea leaves over several successive nights. Because dried tea leaves are hygroscopic, they readily absorb floral essences like jasmine. Our Jasmine Green features a base tea grown by our partners at the Xuan En Yisheng Tea Cooperative, which is prized for its high mountain character and elegant sweetness.

Shiso, also known as Japanese mint or perilla, is a primary flavor in Japanese, Korean and Chinese cuisine. It is an herb related to the mint family with sub-cultivars that are green or red and purple.

Scientists have recently studied the water infusion of shiso in alternative medicine to restore health and bring balance to the body with its high antioxidant values and aromatic compounds. Other notable uses include cold and flu prevention, skincare, respiratory support and digestive aid. Shiso extracts can be found in high-end skincare products, especially in facial toners and anti-aging serums.

The combination of California lemon and shiso create a bright, citrusy, yet tea-like tonic. The synergistic combination of these two ingredients offers flavors of green plum wine, wild oregano, tarragon and citron with a slight minty aroma. Great for both hot and cold brew.

Tulsi, or Holy Basil, is one of the cornerstone adaptogens of Ayurvedic herbology. Astragalus has been used for thousands of years in Traditional Chinese Medicine as a tonifying herb, referencing its ability to nourish and strengthen the vigor and immunity. Astragalus, with its unique and milky-sweet taste, is applied frequently in times of illness. Used as a balancing and harmonizing herb in Traditional Chinese Medicine, Gan Cao, or licorice root, replenishes Qi (life energy) and complements this blend by way of flavor and function. Licorice root has a pleasing and thirst-quenching taste, and it feels soothing on the throat in dry weather. The potent combination of these classic herbs from various global healing modalities yields amazing aroma, refreshing energy and a delicious spice and sweetness.

The tradition of scenting tea with flowers such as jasmine, lotus, pomelo blossoms and other types of flowers is a time-honored craft. Simple infusions of dried flowers were consumed frequently during the Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE) as a purifying palette cleanser before the tea ceremony and really came into vogue during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 CE) when many types of flower-scented teas were created. Chrysanthemums from Korea are prized as one of the most flavorful types of chrysanthemum that can be selected for tea. These blossoms are grown for us in Hadong region of Korea and have a classic taste with core bitter-sweetness and the complex aroma of wintergreen, pine, honey and spring blossoms.

Four Seasons Spring Oolong is a lightly oxidized, tightly rolled, ball shaped oolong tea sourced from our partners of twenty years in Taiwan's central highlands. This oolong is crafted from the Si Ji Chun 四季春, or literally “Four Seasons Spring,” cultivar. The tea has a golden-green, medium-bodied infusion with very floral, long-lasting aromatics evocative of fresh gardenia, freesia blossoms and tropical fruits.

When Korean chrysanthemums are combined with this oolong, the aroma and flavor experience is transformed into something really special and energetic. In Korean herbalist practice, chrysanthemum is regarded as cooling, purifying and a natural source of antioxidants. Chrysanthemum flowers produce various types of flavonoids, which results in anti-inflammatory effects. The simple blend of fresh, green oolong and Korean chrysanthemum creates a whole new bouquet of fragrance—heady and aromatic—nothing else is needed.","oolong tea and chrysanthemum",NA,"5 minutes","/product/image/medium/chro-sana_chrysanthemumoolong-looseleaf-sana.jpg","$32.00","Chrysanthemum Oolong","Oolong Tea & Herbal Blend",NA,NA,NA,"Rishi Herb Lab",NA,NA,NA,"Chrysanthemum Oolong","https://rishi-tea.com/herb-lab-limited-release-botanical-blends/chrysanthemum-oolong?returnurl=%2forganic-loose-leaf-herbal-tea%2f%3fcount%3d65",NA,NA,NA

Back in the days when the kitchen and garden were the people's doctor and pharmacy, herbal liqueurs were concocted by local herbalists in monasteries and apothecaries to ward off the evils and ailments of the day.

Today, herbal liqueurs find their way into craft cocktails and bars all over the world and are ever more popular for their naturally exotic aromatics. Our Herb Lab Series Saffron Bitters is inspired by the complexity and bracingly bitter edge of Fernet Branca with its heady eucalyptus and exotic herbal notes and by La Strega which is noted for its bitter sweet and golden liquor infused with Angelica and saffron.

Rishi's Saffron Bitters is an ode to herbalists' and mixologists' creativity and passion. It can be infused as a herbal tea or cold brewed in vodka for 10 days and filtered to create an herbal liqueur of your own.

This superior quality jasmine tea uses less rounds of scenting than Jasmine Pearl, but is equally beautiful to behold visually and even more stunning in its lush, abundantly aromatic sweetness. This innovative tea is made from pure spring harvest tea buds – the same buds that are typically used to make Jasmine Pearl – but are left in a natural, slightly twisted shape instead of being rolled into a pearl. The result is a tea with an unimaginably rich sweetness that naturally complements the sweet perfume of Jasmine. Because Moonlight Jasmine is not rolled into a pearl, far fewer rounds of scenting are needed to achieve a deeply fixed floral aroma. With its elegant visual appearance, Organic Moonlight Jasmine is sure to become the next beloved style of Jasmine tea.","Organic green tea with jasmine",NA,"3 minutes","/product/image/medium/omj-sana_moonlight-jasmine-organic-loose-leaf-chinese-scented-green-tea-1.jpg","$69.00","Moonlight Jasmine","Organic Green Tea",NA,NA,NA,"Yunnan, China",NA,NA,NA,"Moonlight Jasmine","https://rishi-tea.com/green-tea-organic-loose-leaf/moonlight-jasmine-loose-leaf?returnurl=%2forganic-loose-leaf-herbal-tea%2f%3fcount%3d65",NA,NA,NA

The tradition of scenting tea with flowers such as jasmine, lotus, pomelo blossoms and other types of flowers is a time-honored craft. Simple infusions of dried flowers were consumed frequently during the Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE) as a purifying palette cleanser before the tea ceremony and really came into vogue during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 CE) when many types of flower-scented teas were created. Chrysanthemums from Korea are prized as one of the most flavorful types of chrysanthemum that can be selected for tea. These blossoms are grown for us in Hadong region of Korea and have a classic taste with core bitter-sweetness and the complex aroma of wintergreen, pine, honey and spring blossoms.

Four Seasons Spring Oolong is a lightly oxidized, tightly rolled, ball shaped oolong tea sourced from our partners of twenty years in Taiwan's central highlands. This oolong is crafted from the Si Ji Chun 四季春, or literally “Four Seasons Spring,” cultivar. The tea has a golden-green, medium-bodied infusion with very floral, long-lasting aromatics evocative of fresh gardenia, freesia blossoms and tropical fruits.

When Korean chrysanthemums are combined with this oolong, the aroma and flavor experience is transformed into something really special and energetic. In Korean herbalist practice, chrysanthemum is regarded as cooling, purifying and a natural source of antioxidants. Chrysanthemum flowers produce various types of flavonoids, which results in anti-inflammatory effects. The simple blend of fresh, green oolong and Korean chrysanthemum creates a whole new bouquet of fragrance—heady and aromatic—nothing else is needed.","oolong tea and chrysanthemum",NA,"5 minutes","/product/image/medium/chro-sana_chrysanthemumoolong-looseleaf-sana.jpg","$32.00","Chrysanthemum Oolong","Oolong Tea & Herbal Blend",NA,NA,NA,"Rishi Herb Lab",NA,NA,NA,"Chrysanthemum Oolong","https://rishi-tea.com/herb-lab-limited-release-botanical-blends/chrysanthemum-oolong?returnurl=%2fherb-lab-limited-release-botanical-blends%2f",NA,NA,NA

Its natural extracts are employed as an antiviral in modern medicines and antimalarial drugs. It is used by herbalists in teas and tinctures to unblock pent up Qi (life energy)and to disperse inner heat caused by intermittent fatigue or illness. Artemisia annua is commonly known as """"sweet wormwood"""" and has a special tannin structure similar to green tea and tonic water with notable polyphenols and aromatic compounds that pair well with the green tea and enlivening botanicals of this blend. Artemisia Qi Tonic is caffeinated and energized by Tencha, the stimulating and refreshing Japanese shade-grown tea used to make Matcha. The blend of artemisia and green tea is balanced with aromatic California lemon zest and anti-oxidant rich shiso leaves to create a bitter-sweet, wonderfully fragrant and stimulating infusion to expel dreary winter fatigue.

Each cultivar gives us specific tasting notes. In Tsuji-san's Matcha Samidori, we experience an unctuous aroma with silken, creamy mouthfeel and savory umami reminiscent of uni. Tea bushes for premium matcha are harvested once per year. The farming technique is unique as it utilizes shading, and this focuses the plant's energy on the top, tender leaves. The intense shading forces the bushes to make their leaves fatter and greener, with increased chlorophyll to seek out the sun. In turn, this farming practice greatly enhances the nootropic and neuro-stimulating substances.

Cultivar: Asahi
Elevation: 250m
Harvest: May 7, 2020 

Rishi is lucky enough to be one of the few to whom Tsuji-san sells his matcha, which has been analyzed to have the highest amino acids scores and L-theanine content of any matcha in Japan and the world. Each cultivar gives us specific tasting notes. In Tsuji-san's Matcha Asahi, we experience a velvety mouthfeel with hints of macadamia nut and kombu. Tea bushes for premium matcha are harvested once per year. The farming technique is unique as it utilizes shading, and this focuses the plant's energy on the top, tender leaves. The intense shading forces the bushes to make their leaves fatter and greener, with increased chlorophyll to seek out the sun. In turn, this farming practice greatly enhances the nootropic and neuro-stimulating substances.

Nakanishi-San is a renowned tea producer from Uji, who cultivates tea along the Uji River. Tea from this region tends to emphasize depth and resonance of flavor. The richness of umami taste with savory and sweet flavors akin to kombu, snap pea, hijiki and mushroom-dashi are a real highlight. These lower elevations have warmer soil, which is favored when producing shade-grown teas like Tencha and Gyokuro.

Nakanishi-San's farm is over 300 years old and is JAS certified and organic accredited for more than 30 years. The farm is known for stellar soil management and organic cultivation techniques that result in one of the world's best organic sources of authentic, ceremonial matcha.

Every year we taste a range of individual cultivar production lots of tencha, in leaf form and test-milled into matcha. We taste to understand the unique performance of each cultivar, which varies from season to season. We then assemble and taste trials of cultivar blends to create the perfect CHO WA (harmony and balance) of amaku (umami), koku (density), awaku (briskness), and shibuku (bitterness). The cultivar components of Kirishima Blend shift from season to season, according to our collaborative effort to create the most balanced and vivid expression of this southern Japanese appellation of origin.

Harvest: May 12, 2020

Rishi is lucky enough to be one of the few to whom Tsuji-san sells his matcha, which has been analyzed to have the highest amino acids scores and L-theanine content of any matcha in Japan and the world. Each cultivar gives us specific tasting notes. In Tsuji-san's Matcha Gokou, we experience an invigorating flavor with a pure emerald hue and hints of spruce. Tea bushes for premium matcha are harvested once per year. The farming technique is unique as it utilizes shading, and this focuses the plant's energy on the top, tender leaves. The intense shading forces the bushes to make their leaves fatter and greener, with increased chlorophyll to seek out the sun. In turn, this farming practice greatly enhances the nootropic and neuro-stimulating substances.

Harvest: Late Spring 2020

Our Garden Direct whisky barrel aged teas are a unique expression of Rishi’s core values: Selector, Importer and Maker. We chose two teas for this inventive project: Ruby Oolong and Gui Fei Oolong. After the late spring harvest (before monsoon rains) and traditional processing, we sent them to our close partners in the high mountain Honyama region of Okouchi  to begin the whisky barrel aging process.

Gui Fei is a ball-shaped oolong analog of Bai Hao Oolong featuring “tea leaf hopper bug” bitten leaves that wither and oxidize on the tea bush before harvest. The leaf hopper bitten leaves develop a deep muscatel, honey, wintergreen and fruity-floral taste profile that can only be found in tea gardens attacked by these little bugs. The combination of barrel aging and the style of tea result in unique and brilliant flavors highlighted by the flavors of peat with a long-lasting sweetness touched by vanilla. With each infusion the whisky flavor mellows and rounds, allowing for subtler fruity and floral notes to emerge.","Barrel aged oolong tea",NA,"null","/product/image/medium/gfbat100-rp_guifeibarrelagedtea_looseleaf_sana.jpg","$45.00","Whisky Barrel Aged Gui Fei Oolong","Garden Direct Oolong Tea",NA,NA,NA,"Lu Gu, Zhu Shan, Taiwan",NA,NA,NA,"Whisky Barrel Aged Gui Fei Oolong","https://rishi-tea.com/garden-direct-seasonal-tea/whisky-barrel-aged-gui-fei-oolong-2021?returnurl=%2foolong-tea-organic-loose-leaf%2f%3fcount%3d18",NA,NA,NA

This Premium Iron Goddess of Mercy or Tieguanyin is crafted from the Cui Yu, “Jade,” cultivar. Handpicked tea leaves were harvested from an ecologically managed old growth garden in central Taiwan. This tea goes through a process of medium oxidation, ball-roll shaping and moderate initial roasting to create the base tea. Then after some weeks of resting the batch an artistic and old school baking regimen that takes several more weeks is employed to complete the tea. This baking brings out a sort of “caramelized” sweetness and creamy aroma due to the Maillard reaction—the same transformation that occurs in baking bread, roasting sweet potatoes or roasting coffee. Oolong tea artisans produce baked teas that range from blonde light roasts to medium and deeper roasts. This tea is deeply baked in the Nong Xiang, or “deep fragrance” style. Be sure to rinse the tea to warm up the tea leaves and smooth out the flavor a bit before commencing your Gongfu Cha brewing series of multiple infusions.","Oolong tea",NA,"null","/product/image/medium/dbjo100-rp_1060-iron-goddess-of-mercy-premium-roast-sana.jpg","$44.00","Iron Goddess of Mercy Premium Roast","Garden Direct Oolong Tea",NA,NA,NA,"Mingjian Village, Taiwan",NA,NA,NA,"Iron Goddess of Mercy Premium Roast","https://rishi-tea.com/garden-direct-seasonal-tea/iron-goddess-of-mercy-premium-roast?returnurl=%2foolong-tea-organic-loose-leaf%2f%3fcount%3d18",NA,NA,NA

Our Garden Direct whisky barrel aged teas are a unique expression of Rishi’s core values: Selector, Importer and Maker. We chose two teas for this inventive project: Ruby Oolong and Gui Fei Oolong. After the spring harvest and traditional processing, we sent them to our close partners in the high mountain Honyama region of Okouchi  to begin the whisky barrel aging process.

Ruby Oolong is a special type of oolong tea produced in the Doi Mae Salong mountainous region in northern Thailand and is a full-bodied oolong tea, deeply oxidized and slowly baked to bring out complex layers of tasting notes including a silken mouthfeel and notes of cacao, raisins and black cherry. Thailand has beautiful soil, which is rich and loamy, providing ample nutrients exclusive to this region.

The combination of barrel aging and the style of tea result in unique and brilliant flavors highlighted by the flavors of peat with a long-lasting sweetness touched by vanilla. With each infusion the whisky flavor mellows and rounds, allowing for the quintessential cacao and black cherry nuance to emerge.","Barrel aged oolong tea",NA,"null","/product/image/medium/robat100-rp_rubyoolongbarrelagedtea_looseleaf_sana.jpg","$32.00","Whisky Barrel Aged Ruby Oolong","Garden Direct Oolong Tea",NA,NA,NA,"Doi Mae Salong, Thailand",NA,NA,NA,"Whisky Barrel Aged Ruby Oolong","https://rishi-tea.com/garden-direct-seasonal-tea/whisky-barrel-aged-ruby-oolong-2021?returnurl=%2foolong-tea-organic-loose-leaf%2f%3fcount%3d18",NA,NA,NA

 Taiwan is a celebrated origin of highly-specialized teas. Tea gardens above 1,000 masl are designated as Gao Shan Cha, directly translating as “High Mountain Tea.” Tea from these elevations are extremely precious, and the best lots are produced in the winter and spring harvests. Another notable taste found in superior Gao Shan Cha is Dan Bai Wei—“egg white’s aroma,” referencing the richness of amino acids and creamy mouthfeel. In the West, this essence is perceived as buttery or even umami. The flavors are densely packed due to the influx of nutrients from the plants coming out of their winter hibernation. The spring teas have overall strength, richness and balance.

Dong Fang Hong, """"Eastern Beauty Red,"""" is a newer style of tea that combines oolong and red tea processing methods. The tea leaves of Dong Fang Hong are tumbled and shaken in the yaoqing which is a bamboo cylinder used to mix and bruise the leaves. This encourages specialized oxidation creating multi-faceted aromas and flavors of fruits and florals. The tea is reminiscent of a Second Flush Darjeeling muscatel with nuances of Eastern Beauty oolong from Taiwan, while at the same time showing off a presentation of flavors that is totally new.

Over the past three years we have witnessed the trend of Eastern Beauty oolong processing tactics pushed to the black tea levels of oxidation that mark a new trend amongst South-Eastern Asia, Taiwanese and Yunnan producers.

Gui Fei is typically harvested during mid-summer in Lugu, Taiwan from Jin Xuan or Qingxin tea bush cultivars. This lot is crafted from Jin Xuan (Golden Lily), renowned for its versatility and vigor in a variety of growing conditions. The unforgettable aroma and floral, tropical fruity sweetness is a prime characteristic for this type of tea. The term Gui Fei translates to “Royal Concubine,” which refers to the elegant, beautiful yet matured character of the fresh tea leaves selected for this processing.

Gui Fei Cha features thrips or “tealeaf hopper,” bug-bitten leaves that wither on the bush. As is the case of Darjeeling Muscatel or Eastern Beauty teas, the bug bites are a catalyst for uniquely fruity and floral teas. This lot has a medium and multi-colored oxidation level with a complex fruity aroma and an unforgettable nectar taste. The Yaoqing, or bamboo-basket tumbler is used to bruise the leaves before artisan-controlled withering and Dong Ding Oolong type practices are carried out to harnesses and fixate the unique aromas and depth of flavor. These special techniques create a boozy and fermented profile presenting upfront and lasting fruity flavors with floral and honeyed nuance in the later infusions.","Oolong tea",NA,"null","/product/image/medium/gfo100-rp_1066-gui-fei-sana.jpg","$42.00","Gui Fei Oolong","Garden Direct Oolong Tea",NA,NA,NA,"Taiwan",NA,NA,NA,"Gui Fei Oolong","https://rishi-tea.com/gui-fei-oolong-2021?returnurl=%2foolong-tea-organic-loose-leaf%2f%3fcount%3d18",NA,NA,NA

Hui Gan is a special mouthfeel and tasting effect found in Pu'er teas made from elder tea trees: an initial bittersweet attack transforms into a salivating sweetness throughout the palate.

Cultivar: Menghai Broad Leaf
Harvest Date: Summer 2009

This vintage tea consists of aged shu Pu'er that is compressed into a cake and packed in traditional bamboo leaf bundles called a tong. This reserve Pu'er tea is released only when it is ready. A deep garnet infusion with a dense, opaque liquor bears a mellow sweetness that drinks remarkably smooth with a rich earth body.

There are two types of Pu'er tea: sheng (raw, green) and shu (ripe, dark). Both originate from a rustic sun-dried green tea called shaiqing. Shu Pu'er is made by pile-fermenting shaiqing teas over a period of 85-120 days. Ancient Pu'er Palace is our top grade of shu Pu'er, and is made using leaves picked from ancient tea trees that are hundreds of years old.

Like fine wine, Pu'er tea has the ability to be aged and released in vintages. Young shu Pu'er teas (2-3 years) typically have an assertive body and bold strength. The body and mouthfeel become richer and more integrated as the shu Pu'er continues to age from 4-8 years.","Organic Pu'er tea",NA,"4 minutes","/product/image/medium/oashuputc125-rp_puer-tea-cake-organic-loose-leaf-puer-tea.jpg","$23.00","Shu Pu'er Tea Cake","Organic Pu'er Tea",NA,NA,NA,"Yunnan, China",NA,NA,NA,"Shu Pu'er Tea Cake","https://rishi-tea.com/puer-tea-organic-loose-leaf/puer-tea-cake-organic-loose-leaf-puer-tea?returnurl=%2fpuer-tea-organic-loose-leaf%2f",NA,NA,NA

They resemble young magnolia buds and are cloaked in layers of pink, purple, scarlet and grey-ish colored leaves. People in the region often call this type of tea “fairy tea” because in order to harvest the buds from the large mossy, lichen coated trees, the harvesters look like woodland fairies levitating in the misty treetops.

Jun Chiyabari is located in Hile, a region nestled in the Himalayas in eastern Nepal, due south of Mt. Everest with stunning views of Kangchenjunga. Himalayan White is one of the first harvests of the year from the Ramché & Bokré Divisions. This style of tea follows a processing method very similar to White Peony (Bai Mu Dan), a popular style of white tea made of young tea leaves and silvery unopened leaf buds, also known as two leaves and a bud. The tea is skillfully withered for a long period of time both indoors and outdoors, at room temperature and with cooler air, then lightly dried in an oven. When stored properly, this tea will age beautifully, and features fresh floral bouquet of iris and orchids, hint of ripe peach with a brisk and elegant tannin structure.

Repeated rolling takes place until the tea develops long thin dark green needles at which time it is finally dried to a 4-6% moisture content.
